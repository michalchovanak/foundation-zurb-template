        <h2>Technology <br>
            first</h2>
        <p class="lead">While InoBat Auto is an electric battery production company with numerous supply contracts in
            place and a robust, long term business plan to facilitate the supply of batteries, we are, first and
            foremost, a technology company. </p>
        <p>Research and development sits at the heart of everything we do at our facility in Voderady. Delivering
            sustainable mobility requires constant improvement to every element of a battery – from underlying chemistry
            to packaging. Early-stage R&D of breakthrough next-generation lithium-ion battery cell chemistry and
            materials is key to reducing cost and accelerating speed-to-market. And as the energy storage ecosystem
            develops, cutting edge R&D and focussed pilot production will play an ever more critical role in delivering
            new and promising materials for future battery chemistries. </p>

        <h2>State-of-the-art <br>laboratory <br>
            facilities</h2>

        <p class="lead">Three laboratories, each equipped with the latest technology, give InoBat Auto’s scientists an
            industry-unique advantage to rapidly develop full commercial size battery prototypes, essential for
            capturing real-world data and eliminating risks associated with the transition from prototype to commercial
            scale. </p>
