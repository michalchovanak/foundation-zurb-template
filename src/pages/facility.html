                <p class="lead">While InoBat Auto is an electric battery production company with numerous supply

                    in
                    place and a robust, long term business plan to facilitate the supply of batteries, we are, first and
                    foremost, a technology company. </p>
                <p>Research and development sits at the heart of everything we do at our facility in Voderady.
                    Delivering
                    sustainable mobility requires constant improvement to every element of a battery – from underlying
                    chemistry
                    to packaging. Early-stage R&D of breakthrough next-generation lithium-ion battery cell chemistry and
                    materials is key to reducing cost and accelerating speed-to-market. And as the energy storage
                    ecosystem
                    develops, cutting edge R&D and focussed pilot production will play an ever more critical role in
                    delivering
                    new and promising materials for future battery chemistries. </p>

                <p>Our wet laboratory facilitates synthesis, optimisation and development of new materials, electrode
                    preparation, cell assembly and characterisation, to enhance battery energy density and safety. Our
                    scientists within the dry laboratory determine the best and most cost-effective materials available
                    and
                    analyse every aspect of battery production. Accelerated battery testing is conducted in our E-chem
                    laboratory, where cells can be stored and cycled in fireproof, temperature-controlled chambers
                    ranging
                    from -40 to 80°C.</p>

                    Unencumbered by legacy systems and mindsets, every InoBat Auto employee prioritises flexibility and
                    rapid response to customer needs.

                <p>These values are also reflected in our initial integrated laboratory and semi-automatic pilot line,
                    producing numerous different size pouch formats and chemistries. As our plant structure rapidly
                    develops, the pilot line will provide the foundation for a manufacturing production line capable of
                    producing multiple GWh, evolving to a larger plant and then a series of integrated plants. </p>
