                <h2>Fast and flexible customer centric development</h2>
                <p class="lead">InoBat Auto provides unparalleled R&D capability, enabling customers to leverage unique
                    collaborative partnerships to rapidly design and engineer bespoke, mission-specific, high-margin EV
                    battery solutions, which exceed current industry standards for energy density, efficiency range and
                    time-to-market. </p>
                <p>All cells are lithium-ion and based on nickel-rich chemistry. Both chemistry and form factor are
                    fully variable and can be rapidly adapted and configured to meet precise customer needs. InoBat Auto
                    battery cell technology delivers a level of energy density markedly superior to existing
                    industry-standard batteries. This key advantage results in lighter, smaller batteries, which give
                    manufacturers enhanced vehicle packaging flexibility. Lower resistance and the ability to charge at
                    faster rates for longer ensure significant improvements in range and efficiency.</p>

                <p>After all, the requirements of a 250mph hypercar, where outright performance is key, differ
                    significantly from those of an urban last-mile delivery vehicle where maximum range and cost
                    sensitivity are critical factors. And there is little similarity between the operating parameters of
                    a luxury saloon, which requires consistent energy delivery and a passenger aeroplane, which demands
                    significant power during take-off and landing. Whether the project is an electric power source for a
                    race car, a light commercial vehicle or a bus, our R&D team will work with customers’ engineers and
